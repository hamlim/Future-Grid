          Future-Grid is a <del>yet another</del> CSS grid system. What makes Future-Grid different is that it supports 
          browsers from IE9<sup>*</sup> and up, and it is the first grid system to be implemented with a progressively enhanced 
          variant using CSS Grid.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          Its also a barebones grid system with a responsive sizing system and makes for a quick utility to drop into any 
          new or old website/webapp project.

              The classnames are fairly straight forward, as you can see in the demo <ins class="location"></ins> 
              all you need to do is add a few utility classes to your elements and all the styling is taken care of 
              for you.

              In this example, the layout would be two equal columns on either side of the main section content that would 
              be taking up the middle 8/12ths of the screen.

          <p class="section-text">
            There are two lines of css that break IE8 compatibility by using <code>rem</code>. You can however search 
            and replace the <code>rem</code> with the root font-size (in px! not %/em) of your website and you will be 
            able to use the Future-Grid in IE8.
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            Unfortunately because IE7 doesn't support <code>inline-block</code>, but I really hope you don't have to support IE7 anymore.

          <summary class="details-summary">Why isn't flexbox used on IE11?</summary>
          <p class="section-text">
            IE11 has a really bad track record with the flexbox spec. It has implemented an older version of 
            the spec that has a ton of bugs currently.
          </p>
          <p class="section-text">
            The hack to get around using flexbox on these browsers that support it is to wrap it in an <code>@supports</code> block. 
            Because IE11 doesn't support this in css it ignores the flexbox styles and uses the fallback.

          <summary class="details-summary">Why should I be adopting CSS Grid?</summary>
          <p class="section-text">
            Well besides the fact that the major browser vendors by the middle of this year will all support 
            Grid, it took most CSS developers many <strong>years</strong> to start using Flexbox, and I 
            personally would like to see many of us adopt these new standards.

          <summary class="details-summary">I thought CSS Grid was supposed to be really custom!</summary>
          <p class="section-text">
            It is! A grid framework is really only the barebones. If you feel the need to build full layouts and 
            customize them then remove this css and start writing your own grid system using CSS Grid. I fully 
            believe that with CSS Grid we will no longer need these kind of frameworks.

          <summary class="details-summary">How can I use this in my website/project?</summary>
          <p class="section-text">
            Easy! Just grab the css, modify as needed and add it to your website. The only thing I ask is that you leave a 
            CSS comment attributing me and this repo.

            Well you can grab the raw source and manually edit it to your hearts content, or you can grab the scss
             file and modify it, or grab the postcss file and modify it from there.
